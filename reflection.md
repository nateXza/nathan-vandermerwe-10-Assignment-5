# Reflection  

## Challenges  
1. **Real-Time Processing**: Balancing CNN model accuracy with latency for real-time predictions.  
2. **Edge Cases**: Designing tests for poor-quality images and rare diseases not in the dataset.  
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensuring use cases addressed both farmer usability and expert validation needs.  

## Lessons Learned  
- Use case diagrams clarify complex system interactions for technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
- Non-functional testing (e.g., security) is critical for agricultural data integrity.
